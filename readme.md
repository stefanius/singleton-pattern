#Singleton Desing Pattern

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanius/singleton-pattern.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanius/singleton-pattern)

##Framework Agnostic
This package is usable for any framework or even plain-PHP. So try this on your Laravel, Symfony, Zend or CakePHP project or any other PHP application or framework!

##For (almost) every developer
Traits, abstraction or a contract. This package is complete and ready to use for developers who has a favor for one of the implemented types.

 - Do you like Traits? Good news! There is a trait in this package. 
 - Do you like extending abstract classes? Also for you good news! You just has to extend the abstract class!
 - Are a fan of explicit contract (interfaces) to dictate the concrete class? Also this type of developer is served!
